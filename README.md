# QR-code-API-generator
The API is designed to take in a GET request that includes a URL as a string in the query string. 

## QR code API using Python Flask.
- When the API receives a request, it uses the QR code library to convert the provided URL into a QR code image.
- Then the API sends the image back as a response to the client in form of downloadable image. 
- The client can then use this image to share the URL in a more convenient way, as it can be scanned by any device with a QR code scanner. 
- This can be useful for a variety of use cases such as generating QR codes for business cards, event tickets, or any other scenario where you want to share a link in a quick and easy way.
